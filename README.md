## Approach

The employee Leave Module system is interesting, and Iâ€™m working on it for the first time.
In this project, I followed the structure of "Kredily". Kredily is a Payroll and HR software.i used Kredily to apply for leave in the previous company. so, I follow the Kredily leave structure in this project.


## Time-Taken On Project

 I started working on this project on Friday night after 8 PM and complete this project on Sunday with testing.
